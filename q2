A.  Explain what recursion is and when it is useful.
  It occurs, when method calls upon itself. It is used when we don't know how many times should execute the program and
  saves the memory.
    Explain what the |termination step| and |recursion step| are in a recursive method.
  termination step - end of executing after particular time. It is used in order for not to run infinetely.
  recursion step - method calls upon itself.
B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.

   Stack is a vertical arrangement of links. It follows Last in First Out (LIFO). Example - plates in cafeteria.
   Queue is a horizontal arrangement of links. It follows First in First Out(FIFO). Example - line in cafeteria.
  
C.  Write a class for an element of a doublely-linked list.
public class Doublely {
    public Doublely Next;
    public Doublely Prev;
    public Object obj;

    public Doublely(Object obj, Doublely ele, Doublely prev){
        this.obj = O;
        this.Next = ele;
        this.Prev = prev;
    }
    
    public void append(Doublely Last){
        this.Last().Next = Last;
    }

    public Doublely last(){
        Doublely Temp = this;
        while(Temp.Next != null){
            Temp = Temp.Next;
        }
        return Temp;
    }
}
  
D.  Explain what a Merkle Tree is.  
  Merkle tree is a hash tree which contain large data structures that allow us to validate the data efficiently.
    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
    What is the Merkle root?
  It is the main - parent hash. It is the element on the top of the tree that is the hash of all the data.
    What is the function of a certificate in this data structure?
  With the certificate we can return to the root and to any node needed to verify the document which was used to 
  build the tree.
